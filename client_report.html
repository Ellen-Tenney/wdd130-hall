<h1>Ellen Tenney</h1>
<h2>Client Report:</h2>
<p>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?: 
    I wanted to create a funny and entertaining wireframe with interesting yet simple formatting.</p>
<p>How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?: 
    I emailed him and helped him to build his wireframe.</p>
<p>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?: 
    The two child pages aren't started. The home page is good until the three images on the bottom row. They are all strange sizes. The color scheme is good.</p>
<p>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?: 
    I think I will be a little more detailed for the color scheme.</p>

<h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
<p>How did you manage your development team and comunicate the tasks for your junior devs?: We emailed each other and did our part in Github.</p>
<p>How did you communicate with your client? Was there any issues?: I went to him personally. He did not have all of the materials for the wireframe for the home page or the child pages. I helped him make his home page wireframe.</p>
<p>How did you handle publishing your clients site and sharing it with the client? I let him get a picture of the URL.</p>
<p>How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub?: It went smooth for me, but it took a minute to get all the pages I was supposed to do for a bit.</p>

<h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>
<p>How did you communicate with your team lead? Was there any issues?: 
    I just spoke to them. One of my leads did my html and css for my page, so I just took what they had and tweaked it to look more smooth. The other child page went perfect.</p>
<p>Did you know what was expected of you for each site?: 
    I knew for both of them what was expected at least by the end and got it finished.</p>
<p>Were you able to contribute to your sites?: 
    Yep!</p>
<p>Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the sites?: 
    Nope! It went smoothly. We just did seperate css for each page and it was good.</p>

<h2>General Experience and Reflections</h2>
<p>What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you able to overcome it?: 
    Probably just getting the information from my client. They didn't have anything until I helped, and they didn't really come up with wireframes for the other pages until way late. I managed to finish my page.</p>
<p>What did you enjoy most about this project?: 
    I think it was a good example of a real world experience for how these types of projects go, with clients and lead and jr devs.</p>
<p>What would you do differently if you could do the project again?: 
    Ensure everyone has turned in full wireframes before assigning someone to them. Also, get the github links for each site sent and organized earlier in advance.</p>
<p>Do you feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this experience? Explain.: 
    Yep! I do good following directions, and it was cool to create a page according to someones idea. It was also good to create one for myself.</p>
