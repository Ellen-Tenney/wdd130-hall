<h1>Ellen Tenney</h1>
<h2>Client Report:</h2>
<p>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?: I wanted to create a funny and entertaining wireframe with interesting yet simple formatting.</p>
<p>How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?: I emailed him and helped him to build his wireframe.</p>
<p>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?: The two child pages aren't started. The home page is good until the three images on the bottom row. They are all strange sizes. The color scheme is good.</p>
<p>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?: I think I will be a little more detailed for the color scheme.</p>
